Hi! My name is Ethan and I'm a junior at Columbia University studying math and computer science. I'm an obsessive learner and build tools to improve the quality of life for people.

Currently, I'm aiming to pursue a PhD. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and numerical methods with a focus on algorithms. I'm currently working with Professor [Rachel Cummings](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/rachel-cummings) to develop differentially private machine learning algorithms.

 If you'd like to find out more (or to work on a project with me), please don't hesitate to get in touch.
