[Resume Oracle](https://resume-oracle.netlify.app/) allows users to upload a resume and instantly get a list of jobs that match one's skills from [Adzuna](https://www.adzuna.com/), a website that helps people to get jobs. 

* This projected was created by Ethan Turok and Bill Sun for Columbia's Devfest Hackathon, March 2022. My hackathon submission can be found [here](https://devpost.com/software/resume-oracle?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress).
* The source code for Resume Oracle can be found [here](https://github.com/billsun9/ResumeOracle).
* This work relies upon some code from [PyResParser](https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pyresparser).
